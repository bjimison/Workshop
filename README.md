This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Workshop is a personal workplace where I aim to combine third party API's for weather forecasting and music playing with a place to take notes or create a todo list. I have developed in React.js before, however this will be my first project implementing Redux.
